' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' How to get additional search results using the Bing Map Search service
' 
' This example demonstrates how to provide search for location and keywords using
' the BingSearchDataProvider.Search
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapBingSearchDataProvider_Searchtopic)
' method. In this example, the built-in Search panel is disabled (the
' BingSearchDataProvider.ShowSearchPanel
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapBingSearchDataProvider_ShowSearchPaneltopic)
' property is set to false), because a custom panel is used instead. To start
' search, specify search parameters (location and a keyword) in the custom Search
' panel and click the Search button. All search parameters are passed to the
' Search method and you can see the result in the rich text box element. The
' results contain a display name, and address associated with the search location.
' In addition, the SearchRequestResult.AlternateSearchRegions
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/DevExpressXtraMapSearchRequestResult_AlternateSearchRegionstopic)
' property returns results of searching for alternate regions. Note that if you
' run this sample as is, you will get a warning message saying that the specified
' Bing Maps key is invalid. To learn how to register a Bing Maps account and
' create a key for it, refer to the How to: Get a Bing Maps Key
